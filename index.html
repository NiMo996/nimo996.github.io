    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Nickolas, a tech enthusiast currently pursuing an associate’s degree in Software Development with aspirations to transition 
        from the automotive industry to a career in technology. I’m focused on improving my skills in programming, cybersecurity, and 
        web development, with particular interests in Cybersecurity, Networks, and Object-oriented Programming. Balancing 
        family, work, and studies is a priority for me, and I enjoy learning through hands-on projects, visual cues, and trial and error. I’m 
        also working on certifications like CompTIA A+ and exploring ways to build an impressive tech portfolio.</p>
